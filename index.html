    <h1>sarvesh's component library </h1>
    <p><strong>Sarvesh Shirude</strong> is attending neog.camp and is currently completing levelZero one weekend and assignment at a time.</p>
    <p>This is a component library created by her to better design each element.</p>
    <p>After creating this library she is going to use the components in her <strong>portfolio, blog and all projects</strong> created. This will ensure that all her projects have <strong>consistent themeing and styling</strong></p>

    <h2>@lists</h2>

    <h3>unordered lists</h3>

    <p>We don't want to show bullets in the unordered list. We'll remove that with CSS.</p>

    <ul class="unordered">
        <li>item one</li>
        <li>item two</li>
        <li>item three</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>inline lists</h3>

    <p>Instead of going in a new row, we will create a list which will take columns.</p>

    <ul class="unordered list-inline">
        <li>item one</li>
        <li>item two</li>
        <li>item three</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>reverse ordered lists</h3>
    <p>Counting of will go reverse for this list </p>
    <ol reversed>
        <li>something</li>
        <li>something else</li>
        <li>something elser</li>
    </ol>
